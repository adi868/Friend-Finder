# Friend_Finder
Welcome to Friend_Finder! Friend_Finder is a full-stack site that takes in results from users' surveys, scoring, storing, and comparing their answers with those from other users. Using Heroku, a server is created and is used to route the homepage, survey page, and API Friends List page. By calculating the absolute difference of each user, the application will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall friendship match!
