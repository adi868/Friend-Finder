Welcome to Friend_Finder! Friend_Finder is a full-stack site that takes in results from users' surveys, scoring, storing, and comparing their answers with those from other users. A server from Heroku is used to route to the homepage, survey page, and API Friends List page. By calculating the absolute difference of each user, Friend_Finder will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall friendship match!
